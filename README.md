Hello, I'm Guilherme S. Porto, 25, and live in Brazil. I'm a Mechanical Engineering student who got involved in data analysis during university and I was hooked by the field. Started my data analysis career doing research in a reliability and risk management group focused on concrete-mixer trucks 5 years ago and since then I never stopped working with data analysis.
